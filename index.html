                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                    My education and professional experiences have led me to a profound interest in web development. 
                    I relate coding to playing with legos when I was a little kid, I can build anything I want from scratch with the right pieces. 
                    Now, as a Fullstack developer, I can build websites and apps starting from a blank text editor.
                    When Iâ€™m not coding I love spending my time outdoors diving, fishing, hiking or just reading some random article I found online.
